## DEMO Studio â€“ A Lightweight Tool for Organizing and Curating Digital Art Collections. DEMO is a logic-based system designed to help artists, students, and educators organize, manage, and explore collections of artwork in a structured, digital format.  

## Problem Many artists and creatives struggle to keep track of their work across various projects, mediums, and themes. Without a dedicated system, their digital files often become scattered, unstructured, and difficult to search or manage, especially as their body of work grows.

##  Solution

## DEMO offers a simple, code-driven solution that enables users to:

## -Create and manage organized art collections (called "boards")

## -Add, remove, and edit details of individual artworks

## -Search and filter entries by keyword, artist, or genre

## -Simulate realistic use cases without relying on a graphical interface

## -Created by DEMO



## How We Would Improve This Solution

## With more time or in a future version, we would aim to:

## Build a user interface (CLI, web, or mobile) to make the tool more accessible.

## Implement data export features to share or archive collections.

## Expand functionality with sorting options.
